My name is ElvyLewis Ndung'u. My github link is: https://github.com/Viralelvy360

I am a student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at Dedan Kimathi University.

Being an AI and general technology enthusiast, I have always had that drive and urge to know the mechanics and workings of "smart" systems and also develop some of my own. Thus I started learning c++, python and also took on some courses on web development. I have also joined various data science and artificial intelligence communities and forums such as kaggle and fastai. I have also participated in various competitions in kaggle and still compete in competitions that come up. I have also joined competitive programming challenges such Google Kickstart, HackerRank and Coderank where I have learnt many skills such as good code writing, on various algorithms and data structures and also problem solving skills. I  incorporate these skills in my code writing and development practices.

I also have some knowledge on cybersecurity. I believe that it is of importance that one develops and deploys secure applications. I am still reading more and also practising on various platforms and capture the flag competitions.

With advancements in the artificial intelligence field and all its prospective applications I have taken a keen interest in the subject. It’s my belief that AI will and if used correctly will augment humanity. Making breakthroughs in fields such as science, medicine and food security. There’s still a need for ethics as we explore this field of infinite possibilities.

Joining this program will be life changing as I get to explore and learn more on artificial intelligence, software development and also take on other learning paths offered and learn from this awesome community that you have put together.
