My name is ElvyLewis Ndung'u. My github link is: https://github.com/Viralelvy360
I am student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at Dedan Kimathi University.
Being an AI and general technology enthusiast, I have always had that drive and urge to know the mechanics and workings of "smart" systems and also develop some of my own.

Joining this program will be life changing as I get to explore and learn more on artificial intelligence, software development and also take on other learning paths offered.
