My name is ElvyLewis Ndung'u. My github link is: https://github.com/Viralelvy360

I am a student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at Dedan Kimathi University.

Being an AI and general technology enthusiast, I have always had that drive and urge to know the mechanics and workings of "smart" systems and also develop some of my own. Thus  I started learning python and also took on some courses on web development. I have also joined various data science and artificial intelligence communities and forums such as kaggle and fastai. I have also participated in various competitions in kaggle and still compete in competitions that come up.

With advancements in the artificial intelligence field and all its prospective applications I have taken a keen interest in the subject. It’s my belief that AI will and if used correctly will augment humanity. Making breakthroughs in fields such as science, medicine and food security. There’s still a need for ethics as we explore this field of infinite possibilities.

Joining this program will be life changing as I get to explore and learn more on artificial intelligence, software development and also take on other learning paths offered.
